      <p>it is still a mystery how the first life a protoplasm formed in the ocean water;
      &#8195;
      the word protoplasm comes from greek prōtos ‘first’ and plasma ‘shape’;
      &#8195;
      the protoplasm is considered the building block of all life containing the nucleus and various organelles floating in water;
      &#8195;
      a cell's cytoplasm meaning all of its components except the nucleus is 80% water;
      &#8195;
      all life that exists or has ever existed can trace its origins to this first shape which emerged 3.5 billion years ago from today;
      &#8195;
      the blood of all living beings since from fish to reptiles to humans has largely the exact same mineral composition as sea water;
      &#8195;
      in a mother’s womb the amniotic fluid which nourishes life to being is 98% water;
      &#8195;
      when a child is born they are 75% water;
      &#8195;
      each living cell is 75-80% water;
      &#8195;
      the earth’s surface is 71% water;
      &#8195;
      99% percent of all the molecules in a human body are water molecules;
      &#8195;
      we are all quite literally mostly water;
      &#8195;
      a universal and undeniable connection;
      &#8195;
      the root of ocean is ōkeanos in greek a great stream encircling the earth’s disk;
